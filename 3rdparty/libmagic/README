README for libmagic (alpha release)

libmagic is a free library for automatically determining the type of a file
by performing a series of tests on it. It uses the same ``magic'' databases
as Ian Darwin's file(1) command as of version 3.31. This library was created
with emphasis on portability, efficiency through superior data structures
and conservative use of memory.

libmagic is free software and may be redistributed and/or modified under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.

If you find any bugs, either report them to me or if you are able, try to
fix the bug yourself and send me patches.

The libmagic tarball contains a small demonstration program called
minifile to test out the library; this is only a five minute hack. I'm hoping
to write an implementation of file(1) using libmagic for the release of
version 1.0 of libmagic.

Have fun, and if you have any suggestions please let me know!
